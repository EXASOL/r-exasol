## Installation

You need to have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
installed on Windows for R to be able to compile the package (for Linux see below).
Plus, the R package **devtools** must be available in your workspace
as it contains the `install_github()` method. The EXASOL package itself
depends on the R package **RODBC**, which should be available on install
from Github.

To install the EXASOL package:
```r
devtools::install_github("EXASOL/r-exasol")
```

## Status

The package is currently tested with DBI 0.3.1 and a fork of DBItest 1.0-1; these are not the current versions. 
The package may however work with DBI 0.4.1, but until this is resolved the fitting packages can be loaded from here:

- https://github.com/marcelboldt/DBI
- https://github.com/marcelboldt/DBItest

The low-level methods as regards exa.readData, exa.writeData and exa.createScript may work as expected, so 
should the DBI connection methods (dbConnect etc.; all tests passed). DBI querying methods also get close to being production ready.

Writing tests have not yet been implemented (only quick-tests), but it hopefully happens in the near future.

`dplyr` methods have been moved to a [separate package](https://github.com/marcelboldt/r-exasol-dplyr).

# EXASOL R Package

## Description

The EXASOL R Package offers interface functionality such as connecting to, querying and writing 
into an EXASOL Database (version 5 onwards). It is optimised for massively parallel reading & 
writing from and to a multinode cluster. Implemented are DBI compliant methods for database access, 
querying and modiifcation. The package integrates with EXASOL's InDB R UDF capabilities, which 
allows to deploy and execute R code dynamically from an R application running on a client.

EXASOL is an InMemory RDBMS that runs in a MPP cluster (shared-nothing) environment. 
Leading the TPC-H benckmark, it is considered the fastest analytical data warehouse available. 
The community edition can be downloaded for free from the [EXASOL Community Portal](https://www.exasol.com/portal).


## Prerequisites and Installation

1. Install developer extensions for R to be able to build from sources

   For Windows: Install `Rtools`
   For Linux: Install the `R-devel` (RPM) or `r-base-dev` (Debian) package.

   The packages might change over time, so generally you can go to the
   official R-project website download section for your OS to find the
   package that are needed to build packages.

2. Make sure you have ODBC and EXASOL ODBC installed and
   configured on your system. We recommend to create a DSN pointing to
   your database instance. Read the README of EXASOL's ODBC
   driver package for details.
   
   On Linux, you also need to install the development files for ODBC.
   Therefore please install `unixodbc-devel` (RPM) or `unixodbc-dev`
   (Debian) package.

## Importing the package

To use the package import it as follows:
``` r
library(exasol)
```

## Manual

The package comes with documentation accessible from R via the command `?exasol`.
